## **Project Overview**

This project is a complete **To-Do App** built using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It provides users with an easy-to-use, secure task management system where they can efficiently manage their tasks. The app enhances user experience by displaying tasks in an attractive, responsive layout powered by Tailwind CSS. Whether youâ€™re a student, working professional, or part of a team, this task management system streamlines your daily operations.

The app supports all essential CRUD operations for tasks, handles real-time data using React state management, and offers secure login and session management with JWT. Zod is used to validate structured data and manage user input for a smoother experience.
